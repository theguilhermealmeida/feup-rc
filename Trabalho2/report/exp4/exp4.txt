MIKROTIK ROUTER:

ip address add address=172.16.2.59/24 interface=ether1  
ip address add address=172.16.51.254/24 interface=ether2

MIKROTIK SWITCH:

/interface bridge port remove [find interface=ether24]
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge51 interface=ether24

GNU2:
route add default gw 172.16.51.254  

GNU3:
route add default gw 172.16.50.254 

GNU4:
route add default gw 172.16.51.254 

MIKROTIK ROUTER:

/ip route add dst-address=172.16.50.0/24 gateway=172.16.51.253

GNU2:
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/accept_redirects
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_redirects

route del -net 172.16.50.0/24

traceroute 172.16.50.1
route add -net 172.16.50.0/24 gw 172.16.51.253
traceroute 172.16.50.1

route del -net 172.16.50.0/24

to activate acceptance of icmp:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/accept_redirects
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_redirects
conclusion: we just do one initial hop to 172.16.51.254 and then it will know where to go (the router answers where to go)


GNU3:
ping 172.16.2.254 (to get to the network, tux 3 just knows that he needs to send to the default gateway tux4, the tux4 only knows he has to send to the rc)

MIKROTIK ROUTER:

/ip firewall nat disable 0

GNU3:
ping 172.16.2.254 (an error occured because rc doesn't know how to get to the network becuase nat is disabled so it doesnt convert private to public ip)
